/**
 * There's a zebra crossing appearing in the middle of nowhere with N
 *  blocks in it. The colors of the zebra crossing is represented by a binary string S
 * , where Si
 *  is 1 if the i
 * -th block from the left is white, and 0 if the block is black.
 *
 * Chef really wants to play with the zebra crossing. Although the given zebra crossing might not have alternate black and white blocks, Chef wants to follow the alternating white-black color pattern while crossing it.
 *
 * Initially, Chef stands at block 1
 * . Chef has to jump exactly K
 *  times, and in each jump he has to move forward and jump to a different color than that previously occupied by Chef. More formally, suppose that Chef is currently at block i
 *  and wants to jump to block j
 *  then following conditions should hold:
 *
 * i<j
 * Si≠Sj
 * Output the farthest block Chef can reach with exactly K
 *  jumps. If Chef cannot jump exactly K
 *  times, output -1.
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains an integer T
 *  denoting the number of test cases. The T
 * test cases then follow.
 * The first line of each test case contains two integers N
 *  and K
 * .
 * The second line of each test case consists of a binary string of length N
 * denoting the color of blocks of the zebra crossing.
 * Output Format
 * For each test case, output the farthest block Chef can reach with exactly K
 * jumps, or -1 in case Chef cannot jump exactly K
 *  times.
 *
 * Constraints
 * 1≤T≤105
 * 2≤N≤103
 * 1≤K≤N
 * Sum of N
 *  over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
